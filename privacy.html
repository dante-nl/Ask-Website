		<p>Ask! is a Discord bot and it stores various bits of data. <strong>When you use the Ask! Discord bot, you
				automatically agree to this.</strong></p>
		<h2 id="data-we-store">Data we store</h2>
		<p>Ask! saves information about you for moderation purpises and because the Ask! bot uses this data to allow for the
			identifiers (IDs). This means you can ask, edit and answer questions with a simple five character string.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>A question&#39;s Ask! ID</p>
				<p> Ask! uses a system with IDs. Ask! generates an ID upon the creation of the questions. The ID consists of two
					numbers (0-9) and three letter (A-z). An example of an ID would be <code>7Va1T</code>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The question itself</p>
				<p> We store the question itself, so that this can be used by the Ask! bot and moderators.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The question history</p>
				<p> Whenever a question gets edited, this the question that used to be the question is saved. </p>
				<p> For example, the original question would be:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>How do I open this jar?</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p> And the author edits the question so it reads the following:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>How do I open this .jar file?</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p> The original question is stored automatically by the Ask! bot.</p>
				<p> If a question is not deleted, the question history is publicly available with the <code>/history</code>
					command. (if there is a history) Moderators can always view a question&#39;s history.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The author ID</p>
				<p> Every Discord account, including bots, has a unique ID. This ID can be used for moderation purposes, such as
					banning people from using the Ask! Discord bot.</p>
				<p> We store data about of question, which includes the question itself, its answers, who asked the Discord
					profile ID of the person who asked it (author ID), and the ID of the message. If the question is deleted,
					this also includes data about who deleted the question (a moderator of the author) and if the question is
					deleted in the first place.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The message ID</p>
				<p> This is the message ID of the message sent in the Ask! Discord server, this is used to edit the message when
					it gets deleted.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Answer data</p>
				<p> We store data of answers of the questions. This is the answer itself and the author ID.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> All of this data is kept upon deletion, and if a moderator knows the ID, the entire question
			history can be viewed.</p>
