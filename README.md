Ask! is a Discord bot that allows you to ask questions and get them answered in Discord. Ask! is a well-made bot optimised for this.

### Easy to use

Ask! is designed to be really easy to use! All you have to do to ask a question is just to to `/ask <question>` and `<question>` should be replaced with the question you want to ask, and you're done! 

Your question is now in the in the [Discord server](https://ask-bot.gq/discord) and can be read by everyone, unless you delete your question, or a moderator deletes your question. This question can be responded to by using `/answer <ID>` and `<ID>` should be replaced by the uinique ID Ask! gave your question when it was asked. When your question is answered, you should get a DM from Ask! or if you have your DMs disabled, you will be pinged in the Discord server.

### Commands

All commands can be found using `/help`, or just browsing the slash command menu! But, we'll list a few of the most important commands.
Text between greater than (`>`) and smaller than (`<`) signs should be replaced with a value. For example, `<ID>` should be replaced by an Ask! ID, which consists of two numbers and three letters.

`/answer <ID> <answer>`	    â€” Answer a `<question>` with `<ID>`.

`/ask <question>`           â€” Ask a `<question>`

`/edit <ID> <new question>`	â€” Edit question with `<ID>` to `<new question>`

`/help`                     â€” Gives you information, you can invite the bot via this command, or learn more about commands.

`/ping`                     â€” Gives you the current ping

`/toggle-dms`               â€” Allows you to enable or disable whether the bot should send you DMs or not.
