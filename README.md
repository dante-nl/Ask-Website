Ask! is a Discord bot that allows you to ask questions and get them answered in Discord. Ask! is a well-made bot optimised for this.

### Easy to use

Ask! is designed to be really easy to use! All you have to do to ask a question is just to to `/ask <question>` and `<question>` should be replaced with the question you want to ask, and you're done! 

Your question is now in the in the [Discord server](https://ask-bot.gq/discord) and can be read by everyone, unless you delete your question, or a moderator deletes your question. This question can be responded to by using `/answer <ID>` and `<ID>` should be replaced by the uinique ID Ask! gave your question when it was asked. When your question is answered, you should get a DM from Ask! or if you have your DMs disabled, you will be pinged in the Discord server.
